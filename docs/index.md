## Philosophy

vLitejs was created with the minimum functionality required for a video player with a custom theme. The performance and weight of the library are therefore very important and this is the main vision of vLitejs.

The library is composed of a Javascript `Player` class, extended by Youtube and HTML5 videos. It is therefore possible to add other popular video services in the future.

## Github & npm

The plugin is available as the `vlitejs` package name on [Github](https://github.com/yoriiis/vlitejs) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vlitejs).<br />
